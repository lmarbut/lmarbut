- ✨Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile. This is my README introduction. On my GitHub you will find the source files for the current projects I am completing.✨

- 👋 Hi, I’m @lmarbut. I am a beginner programmer who has recently graduated from Colorado Technical University with a Bachelor's Degree of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Enginneering. I am familiar with and eager to learn more about the following lanugages in particular: Java, C++, Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, and C#. I am working on completing online coding challenges to improve my skillset and posting my progress as I reach my goals in the form of coding files in repositories on GitHub.

- 👀 I’m interested in new technologies, the application of Computer Science in fields such as Healthcare, Accounting and Business Management. I am interested in learning more about the Scrum process and the duties of Scrum Masters. I am also interested in web development, mobile application development both for recreational purposes and for business, and in User Design and User Experience.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about C# and Java and the syntax and logic of these languages. I am also interested in the Microsoft Stack and LAMP. I want to learn more specifically about Linux Systems and the .NET framework as well as other components of the Microsoft Stack such as cloud servers. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly development projects, especially those using SQL for database management and a web-based API or website platform.

- 📫 I am available for contact by email at marbutlauren@gmail.com or through my LinkedIn account https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-marbut
